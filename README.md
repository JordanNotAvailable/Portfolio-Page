# Demo-Portfolio-Page

## Description

This porject was built to help me practice and put to use the topics I'm currently learning, HTML and CSS mainly focusing on the CSS side of things and it was done by creating a site from scratch making the html, css and reset css files to piece together a practice run of making a portfolio page. Doing this allowed me to see parts I can work on wihting my HTML and CSS like positoning and linking and parts I'm good at like page resizing.
