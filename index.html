    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello my names Jordan, I'm a 22 year old who started as a labourer before covid hit, towards the end of the lockdowns I completed a course and got my Cert 3 in Business Operations and 
        started developing my start up at the beginning of 2021, a job seek and advertising platform but I wanted to have a spicalised area of business so I started working sales jobs from telesales both B2C and B2B
        to door to door slowly improving how I pitch to eventually have a success rate of 30.9% on cold calls for my own business and making at peak 1246 calls in a day for the tele company I was working for.
        I've decided to put my business on hold while I continue to develop and expand my skill set as I now take on learning how to code and adding development to my business and sales skill set.
    </p>
